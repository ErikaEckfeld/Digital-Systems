> this is the block quote for the assignment. I want to make sure that it is long enough to wrap so I will keep on writing. I really like flowers, cooking, and coding. Online classes are great because I can do them from my bed!

A few of my favorite things:
1. Summer time
2. Getting good grades
4. Snow days from school
5. Raindrops on roses

A few of my least favorite things:
* being "shhhed"
* getting bad grades
* getting really cold
* when you wave back at someone who wasn't waving at you
